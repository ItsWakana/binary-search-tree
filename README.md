# Binary Search Tree

This project was definitely a big step up compared to the linked list project. Working on non linear data structure methods was much more of a challenge, especially the delete functionality with all the seperate conditions. I got to implement lots of recursive methods during this project, and while I still feel like I struggle with recursion I feel more comfortable using it.

## What I learned

- How to work on non-linear data structure methods
- Implementing more recursive methods on data
- Binary search tree traversal methods and BFS and DFS
- The importance of rebalancing a binary tree if nodes have been inserted after creation

## How I could improve moving forward

- I need more time implementing recursive methods on binary tree data, I still find myself having a hard time tracing the functionality
- I'd like to work on breadth first search and depth first search and understanding when to use which in certain situations
